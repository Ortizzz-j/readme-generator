# readme-generator

## Purpose

 This app was created to make the process of creating a readme simpler and more automated and repeatable.
 
## Motivation

 The motivation to creating this was also because it can be a struggle on what questions a new developer should ask themselves when writing a read me so it is a nice way to just answer simple questions and get out a quality readme.
 
## Sample

 There is a sample of a readme created with the app in the develop folder. There is also a link to a video on the app being used in the develop/readme folder.
